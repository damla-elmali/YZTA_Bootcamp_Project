## 📝 Sprint 3 Notes

#### 📈 Metrics

| Metric                 | Value |
|------------------------|-------|
| Expected Story Points  | 100   |
| Completed Story Points | 100   |

#### 👥 Sprint 3 Review Participants

- Damla Elmalı – Scrum Master  
- Ömer Faruk Baltacı – Product Owner  
- Kadir Akyürek – Developer  

### 📋 Sprint 3 Summary

- The project pivoted from **SympTrack** (medical symptom tracking) to **EduSona** (personalized education platform) in July 2025.  
- Dataset for medical risk prediction provided only ~32% accuracy despite extensive preprocessing and experimentation, indicating that continuing on the same dataset was inefficient.  
- Finding a novel and suitable dataset aligned with initial health domain idea proved difficult.  
- Decided to pivot to a project better aligned with the team's expertise and goals.  
- Redesigned frontend completely using React.  
- Rebuilt backend APIs for managing courses, users, and content.  
- Integrated AI recommendation algorithms to personalize learning paths.  
- Enhanced overall user experience and UI components.

### ✅ Retrospective

**What Went Well:**  
- Quick analysis and resolution of project challenges during pivot.  
- Successful transition to a new project scope and tech stack.  
- Good team collaboration and role adaptation.

**What Could Be Improved:**  
- Some team members contributed less during the pivot phase.  
- Key feature — user preferences saving — remains incomplete.  
- Time management could have been more efficient.  
- Due to team availability and scheduling constraints, team cohesion was not at its best. Teamwork and collaboration could have been stronger.

**Summary:**  
Sprint 3 marked a fresh start with a shift in project focus and scope. Despite the challenges this brought, the team’s solidarity and swift decision-making laid the foundation for the project. With further development, a more complex and feature-rich platform can be built. Given the current state of the project, we — the three remaining active team members — are satisfied with our progress and commitment.
