## 🤖 SympTrack: AI-Powered Symptom Monitoring and Risk Classification System

SympTrack is an AI-driven health assistant that analyzes user-reported symptoms using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to assess their potential health risks. The system categorizes user input into **low**, **medium**, or **high** risk levels and provides relevant guidance based on medical context.

The goal of this project is to contribute to **early risk awareness** through AI-supported insights — especially in scenarios where access to healthcare professionals might be delayed.
